  abstract	  = {The computation of ionic solvation free energies from atomistic simulations is
		    a surprisingly difficult problem that has found no satisfactory solution for
		    more than 15 years. The reason is that the charging free energies evaluated from
		    such simulations are affected by very large errors. One of these is related to
		    the choice of a specific convention for summing up the contributions of solvent
		    charges to the electrostatic potential in the ionic cavity, namely, on the basis
		    of point charges within entire solvent molecules (M scheme) or on the basis of
		    individual point charges (P scheme). The use of an inappropriate convention may
		    lead to a charge-independent offset in the calculated potential, which depends
		    on the details of the summation scheme, on the quadrupole-moment trace of the
		    solvent molecule, and on the approximate form used to represent electrostatic
		    interactions in the system. However, whether the M or P scheme (if any)
		    represents the appropriate convention is still a matter of on-going debate. The
		    goal of the present article is to settle this long-standing controversy by
		    carefully analyzing (both analytically and numerically) the properties of the
		    electrostatic potential in molecular liquids (and inside cavities within
		    them).}

		    by the sender in unit time. The second is the throughput, which is the amount of
		    data received by the receiver in unit time. Note that the throughput will always
		    be less than or equal to the send rate due to losses. Finally, the number of
		    non-duplicate packets received by the receiver in unit time gives us the goodput
		    of the connection. The goodput is always less than or equal to the throughput,
		    since the receiver may receive two copies of the same packet due to
		    retransmissions by the sender. In a previous paper, we presented a simple model
		    for predicting the steady state send rate of a bulk transfer TCP flow as a
		    function of loss rate and round trip time. In this paper, we extend that work in
		    two ways. First, we analyze the performance of bulk transfer TCP flows using
		    more precise, stochastic analysis. Second, we build upon the previous analysis
		    to provide both an approximate formula as well as a more accurate stochastic
		    model for the steady state throughput of a bulk transfer TCP flow.},
